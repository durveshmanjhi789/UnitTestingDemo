# UnitTestingDemo

**Demo Project for Unit Testing in SwiftUI using MVVM**

This project is a simple **To-Do List app** built with **SwiftUI** and **MVVM architecture**, designed to demonstrate unit testing in iOS.

## Features

* Add, view, and manage To-Do items.
* Input validation: prevents adding empty To-Do items.
* Fully tested with **unit tests** for:

  * Adding new items
  * Handling empty inputs
  * ViewModel logic

## Architecture

* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Clean separation of UI and business logic.
* **SwiftUI**: Modern UI framework for declarative UI.
* **Unit Testing**: Demonstrates testing of ViewModel logic and data handling.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:durveshmanjhi789/UnitTestingDemo.git
```

2. Open `UnitTestingDemo.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Run the app on a simulator or device.
4. Run tests using **Cmd + U** or through Xcodeâ€™s test navigator.

## Goal

This project serves as a demo to showcase **writing unit tests** in a SwiftUI + MVVM project, focusing on **robust logic and testable code**.

If you want, I can also **make a shorter, resume-friendly version** of this README that you can use as a portfolio highlight. Do you want me to do that?
